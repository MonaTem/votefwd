# Welcome to Vote Forward 

The Vote Forward project seeks to revitalize American democracy by dramatically boosting voter turnout.

We provide the tools for individual citizens to mail one another heartfelt hand-written letters that encourage voting.

If you're interested in helping by sending your own letters, or if you just want
to stay informed, sign up at https://votefwd.org.
