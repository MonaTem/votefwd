            <p>Vote Forward is a federally registered 527 committee that encourages voter turnout and helps volunteers elect candidates who reflect our values through a variety of activities aimed at influencing the outcome of the next election.</p>
            <p>This website, <a href="https://votefwd.org">votefwd.org</a> (the “Site”) is operated by Vote Forward PAC 2018. (“We” or “Us” or “Vote Forward”). We strive to protect your privacy and treat your privacy as we do our own. We wrote this privacy policy to let you know how we treat your personal information – and to show you all the ways we work to keep it safe and private.</p>
            <p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from our email list, you may do so by emailing info@votefwd.org. The Site is directed to users in the United States only.</p>
            <p>Vote Forward will send you updates by email.</p>
            <p>We do not share the information you’ve given us with unaffiliated groups without your explicit permission. We may share some of your personal information with the following affiliated groups:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Affiliated Third Parties – for example, our database administrators or organizations that provide extra organizers at an urgent time – for the sole purpose of helping Us do our work. These groups do not share your personal information or use it for any purpose other than as instructed by Us.</li>
              <li>Third Party Administrators, such as organizations we engage to facilitate large distribution of messages. The content of these emails will be from Vote Forward and these third parties do not have direct access to your personally identifiable information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each time you visit this Site or provide us with information through the Site, by doing so you are accepting practices described in the privacy policy in effect at that time. You are also accepting our specific rules or terms of use which may be posted on specific sections of the Site, including areas for making donations, signing petitions or sending letters and emails, and taking part in other campaigns.</p>
            <h5>Sending Letters Via Vote Forward</h5>
            <p>A key component of our project is that we enable you to send letters to potential voters. You are solely responsible for the specific message(s) you send using our letters tool.</p>
            <h5>Financial Donations</h5>
            <p>If you choose to make a donation to Vote Froward, your credit card information will be used only for this transaction through a secure third party online payment system which will be encrypted using SSL technology. Vote Forward does not retain credit card information.</p>
            <h5>Children</h5>
            <p>Vote Forward does not solicit personally identifying information from children. Visitors who are under 13 years of age should ask their parent or legal guardian for assistance when using the Site and should not submit any personally identifying information to the Site. Visitors under 18 years of age should not make donations.</p>
            <h5>Cookies</h5>
            <p>Some parts of the Site may be password-protected. We will use a cookie (cookies reside on your computer and are under the control of your browser) to enable you to return to password-protected areas of the website without having to re-enter your password. If you wish to disable these cookies, the help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how do that. If you set your browser to disable cookies, however, you may not be able to access certain parts of this Site.</p>
            <h5>Advertising</h5>
            <p>We may place online advertising with third-party vendors, including Google, which will be shown on other sites on the internet. In some cases, those third-party vendors may decide which ads to show you based on your prior visits to the Site. At no time will you be personally identified to those third-party vendors, nor will any of the information you share with us be shared with those third-party vendors. If you prefer to opt out of the use of these third-party cookies on the Site, you can do so by visiting the <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/">Network Advertising Initiative opt out page</a>.</p>
            <h5>Data Tracking</h5>
            <p>In order to better serve our members, we use cookies and periodically analyze web logs. We may also use third-party services such as Google Analytics. This helps us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems with our website. We may also use embedded images in emails to track open rates for our mailings, so that we can tell which mailings appeal most to Vote Forward members.</p>
            <p>URLs contained in emails may contain an ID that enables us to correctly identify the person who takes an action using a web page. We use these URLs to simplify the process of signing petitions and filling out surveys. We may occasionally present a shortened URL that references a longer URL which contains an ID—we do this to simplify the display, to prevent links from becoming broken when copied, and to ensure compatibility with email programs which do not handle long URLs. When a shortened URL is displayed in an email, you will see the full URL in the browser’s address bar when you access the page.</p>
            <h5>Data Collection</h5>
            <p>In order to register as a volunteer or user of the Site, we ask for and collect the following user-submitted information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Email address</li>
              <li>Full name</li>
              <li>ZIP code</li>
              <li>The answer to the question: "Do you commit to vote in every election?"</li>
              <li>The answer to the question: "Are you a U.S. Citizen or legal permanent resident?" (Note, a "no" answer disqualifies you from using the Site.)</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h5>
            <p>We may share aggregate information about who and where our members are with third parties including, but not limited to, legislators, partner organizations, and political campaigns. This information will be disclosed in aggregate form only and will not, under any circumstances, contain personally identifiable information. Examples of this type of aggregate data include, but are not limited to, how many Vote Forward members live in a town, or how many new people from a particular state have joined Vote Forward this year. We may also use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
            <h5>Links to Other Websites</h5>
            <p>Vote Forward may provide links to third party websites, and other websites may provide links to the Site. Third party websites operate according to their own terms of use and privacy policies. Vote Forward has no control over such third party websites, and by using this Site, you acknowledge and agree that Vote Forward is not responsible for the availability of such third party sites, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites. You further acknowledge and agree that Vote Forward will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites.</p>
            <h5>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h5>
            <p>Vote Forward may revise or amend this policy at any time at our sole discretion. If we make any substantive changes in the way we collect or use personally identifying information provided by users, we will post a prominent announcement on our website home page and post the changes on this page. We will never change our policies and practices to make them less protective of user information collected prior to the effective date of any changes without the consent of affected users. We encourage users to visit this page periodically to review our current policy.</p>
            <h5>Contact</h5>
            <p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, your personal information, or the practices of this Site, you can contact us at info@votefwd.org.</p>
