                        <p>We’ve reviewed your account and approved you to start adopting unlikely-to-vote Democrats in key swing districts. Welcome!</p>
                        <p>To get started, head back over to <a href="https://votefwd.org" target="_blank">https://votefwd.org</a>, sign in, and click on the “Adopt 5 Voters” button.</p>
                        <p>Detailed instructions below. If you're able to post a photo of your first letter on social media, please do! It helps spread the word to other potential volunteers.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for helping to flip Congress blue in November!</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,<br/>Scott & the Vote Forward team</p>

                        <li>Click the <strong>“Adopt 5 Voters”</strong> button.</li>
                        <li>Click the <strong>"Download all"</strong> button.</li>
                        <li><strong>Print</strong> the PDF that's downloaded to your computer. Notice the <strong>return address</strong> and the <strong>recipients' addresses</strong> on the first page.</li> 
                        <li>On each letter <strong>hand-write</strong>:</li>
                          <ol type="a">
                            <li>The salutation — e.g. "Dear Katherine". (Notice that the recipient's name and address are also on each letter at the bottom in small type for easy reference).</li>
                            <li>Your completion of the sentence "I have pledged to vote in every election because..."</li>
                            <li>Your signature at the bottom.</li>
                          </ol>
                        <li>(optional) <strong>Take and post a photo</strong> of the top half of the letter social media. Use the tag #VoteForward or @votefwd, and say something about why you're volunteering to send letters. (Make sure the "Pledge Code" on the letter isn't visible in your photo!)</li>
                        <li>Hand-write the <strong>recipient's address</strong> on an ordinary envelope</li>
                        <li>Hand-write your first name and last initial and the <strong>return address</strong> on the envelope.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fold and stuff</strong> the letter in the envelope.</li>
                        <li>Put a <strong>stamp</strong> on it. Stamps with personality are encouraged! Mr. Rogers, for example.</li>
                        <li><strong>Set aside</strong> until October. We will all send our letters one week before the election, on October 30.</li> 
                        <li><strong>Click the green checkboxes</strong> on the website to mark letters "prepped" so we know it's ready to go.</li> 
                        <li><strong>Repeat</strong> for all your adoptees...then adopt some more. :)</li>
