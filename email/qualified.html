                        <p>We’ve reviewed your account and approved you to start adopting unlikely-to-vote Democrats in key swing districts. Welcome!</p>
                        <p>To get started, head back over to <a href="https://votefwd.org" target="_blank">https://votefwd.org</a>, sign in, and click on the “Adopt 5 Voters” button.</p>
                        <p>Detailed instructions are enclosed below. You can also <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/voteforward-production-static/20180814-votefwd-instructions.pdf">click here</a> to download printable instructions.</p>
                        <p>If possible, <strong>please post a photo</strong> of the top half of the first letter you write to the social media outlet of your choice. Use the tag #VoteForward and/or @votefwd and explain why you're volunteering to send letters. (Make sure the "Pledge Code" in the third paragraph isn't visible in your photo! It should look something like <a href="https://twitter.com/ohtwinmom/status/1022465181559992321">this</a>:</p>
