                          Please be sure to use the same method to sign <strong>in</strong> that you used to sign <strong>up</strong>. That is, if you signed up with an email address and password, sign back in with that same email address and password. If you signed up by clicking the "Sign up with Facebook" or "Sign up with Google" buttons, sign back in the same way.
                        </li>
                        <li>Click one of the <strong>“Adopt Voters”</strong> buttons.</li>
                        <li>Click the <strong>"Download all"</strong> button. Note: some volunteers have reported being unable to download these files on iOS devices. If it doesn’t work for you, please try using a different device, like a laptop or desktop computer. If you don‘t have one and you're in a hurry to get started, <a href="mailto:help@votefwd.org">email us</a>. As a stopgap, until we get this fixed, we can generate the PDF on your behalf and send it to you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Print</strong> the PDF. Notice the addresses on page 1.</li>
                        <li>On each letter <strong>hand-write</strong>:</li>
                        <ol type="a">
                          <li>"Dear Amy" (Note: the recipient’s info is on each letter at the bottom in small type for easy reference).</li>
                          <li>The completion of the sentence "I have pledged to vote in every election because..."</li>
                          <li>Your signature at the bottom.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>Hand-write the <strong>recipient’s name and address</strong> on an ordinary envelope</li>
                        <li>Hand-write your first name and last initial and the <strong>return address</strong> on the envelope. The return address is in small type at the bottom of each letter, a UPS mailbox rented for this purpose.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fold and stuff</strong> the letter in the envelope.</li>
                        <li>Put a <strong>stamp</strong> on it. Stamps with personality are encouraged! Mr. Rogers, for example.</li>
                        <li><strong>Set aside</strong> until October 30. We will all send our letters one week before the election. (We‘ll remind you!).</li>
                        <li><strong>Click the green checkboxes</strong> on the website to mark each letter "prepped" so we know it’s ready to go.</li>
                        <li><strong>Repeat</strong> for all your adoptees...then adopt more. &#9786;</li>
